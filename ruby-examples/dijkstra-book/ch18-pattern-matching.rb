#
# [note2]: Note that p.high is defined as a shorthand for +p[p.length-1]+
#
# To make this easier, it's helpful to define an additional predicate symbol:
#
# @let partMatch(str, r, s): all l : r <= l <= s-1 : p[l-r] == x[l]
# @note (partMatch(x, r, s) and s-r >= p.length) => matchAt(r)

# Then

# Step IIb. This is the tricky part of the reasoning.
# We want to find some r2, r <= r2 <= s that preserves the invariants P.1 and P.2.
# In particular, since P.2.[r->r2] => partMatch(x,r2,s)
# that means partMatch(x,r2,s) must still hold.
#
# We've already scanned the characters from r through s and don't
# want to scan them again. But because we already know partMatch(x,r,s),
# we already know that the characters of x starting at r
# will be the same as the characters of p starting at 0. Therefore:
#
# @note (partMatch(x,r,s) and partMatch(p,r2-r,s-r)) => partMatch(x,r2,s)
#
# We can decide which r is correct by creating a lookup table d that satisfies:
#
# @let Pd: all k : 0 < k <= p.length :
#   d[k] == min.(l : 1 <= l <= k : partMatch(p,l,k))
#
# Then, if we choose r2 == r + d[s-r] and k == s-r, we can conclude:
#
# @note partMatch(x,r,s) and Pd
#       => partMatch(x,r,s) and partMatch(p,d[s-r],s-r)
#       => partMatch(x,r,s) and partMatch(p,r2-r,s-r)
#       => partMatch(r,r2,s)
#
# We also need to show that no matches could start between r and r3:
#
# @note Pd => all r3: r < r3 < r2 : non partMatch(p,r3-r,s-r)
#       => all r3: r < r3 < r2 : non partMatch(x,r3,s)
